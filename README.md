# Portfolio-Tracker
PORTFOLIO TRACKER
The purpose of this project is to help investors calculate P&L and conduct relevant analysis on their portfolio based on transactional data. 
The program is primarily written in python using libraries such numpy, pandas and matplotlib. A small portion of this program is written in cython for efficiency, specifically for calculations that require iterations over rows. 
It contains two class objects Stock and Portfolio. Stock is used to analyze single stock portfolios while Portfolio is used to analyze multi stock portfolios.
